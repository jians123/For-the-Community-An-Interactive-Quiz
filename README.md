Project #5

Being someone who pay close attention to our mother earth and also the environment sustainability, Im always curious if most of the people around me have at least some basic knowledge about the importance of recycling, as this could really help to build a sustainable environment for everyone. Thus, I think this quiz is really a good chance for me to test if people around are having this important knowledge. And if not, its also a good chance for myself to work on bringing this awareness to more people.
